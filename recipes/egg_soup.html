        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Egg drop soup (or egg flower soup) is a Chinese soup that features silky strands of eggs in chicken broth. The beaten egg is whisked into the boiling broth at the end of cooking, creating delicate strands or flakes that float on top of the broth. It often has seasonings (like salt and white pepper), tofu, and/or some sort of green garnish. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Broth: Use store-bought or homemade chicken broth. </li>
            <li>Sauces and oils: Soy sauce and sesame oil lend savory, umami-rich flavor. </li>
            <li>Water and cornstarch: A water and cornstarch slurry is optional, but it slightly thickens the soup (this is typical of Western variants). </li>
            <li>Egg: It wouldn’t be “egg drop soup” without an egg!</li>
            <li>Chives: Garnish each serving with fresh chives for a pop of bright flavor and color. </li>
            <li>Seasonings: Simply season the egg drop soup with salt and white pepper if you like. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the broth with the soy sauce and sesame oil. </li>
            <li>Pour the slurry and food coloring into the boiling broth (if using). </li>
            <li>Slowly pour in the beaten egg and season. </li>
        </ol>
